When you think Tim McGraw, I hope you think of me.
You're just another picture to burn.
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
Oh I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world.
I've never been anywhere cold as you.
I've never been on the outside.
You're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone.
Stay beautiful.
You should've said no, should've gone home.
Take me back to the house in the backyard trees.
Our song is a slamming screen door.
And I'm only me when I'm with you.
We could be a beautiful miracle, instead of just invisible.
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart.

I'd dance in a storm in my best dress, fearless.
But I didn't know it at fifteen.
It's a love story, baby just say 'yes'.
Hey Stephen.
It's too late for you and your white horse to come around.
Why can't you see, you belong with me.
I can't breathe without you, but I have to.
I know that you see what you're doing to me, tell me why.
You're not sorry, no.
That's the way I loved you.
Flashback to when he said 'forever and always'.
I know I had the best day with you today.
These things will change, can feel it now.
'Cause I'mma stay through it all, so jump then fall.
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun.
Just know I'm right here hoping you'll come in with the rain.
Gimme a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar.
I know all I need is on the other side of the door.
Today was a fairytale, you were the prince.
I've still got you all over me.
Hello, Mr Perfectly Fine.
And we were happy.
That's when, when I wake up in the morning.
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been.
Bye bye baby.
